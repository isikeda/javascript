## _Guess The Number_ Project

I followed the course for this project. Also, I made some changes in the project.

###### Changes in the CSS features

- Again button replaced from top left to the right
- The font has changed.

###### Added properties with JavaScript

- An "Enter" keydown property has added for checking the guessed number.
- The property that turns the background color to red instantly when the guess is wrong added.
- If the guess is close to **the number** _Low!_ shows up instead _Too low!_
- An alert message that introduces the game to the user.
